    <h1>About Fake News Detection</h1>
    <p>Fake news detection is the process of identifying and analyzing misinformation and false information presented as legitimate news. With the rise of social media and online platforms, fake news has become a significant issue affecting public opinion, trust in media, and even political discourse.</p>
